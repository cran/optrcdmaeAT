Description: Computes A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-optimal row-column designs for two-colour cDNA microarray experiments using the linear fixed effects and mixed effects models where the interest is in a comparison of all pairwise treatment contrasts. The algorithms used in this package are based on the array exchange and treatment exchange algorithms adopted from Debusho, Gemechu and Haines (2018) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2018.1429617> algorithms after adjusting for the row-column designs setup. The package also provides an optional method of using the graphical user interface (GUI) R package tcltk to ensure that it is user friendly.
